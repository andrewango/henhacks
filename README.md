## Inspiration
As college students, we understand how overwhelming it can be to manage your financial life without guidance, whether it comes to your education, rent, food expenses, or personal hobbies. The objective of this project is to provide a stepping stone for those who want to improve their financial management.

## What it does
EnHence is a website application designed to provide easily digestible information about financial resources. There is a set of personal loans and banks with their respective details bundled nicely together according to category. Further, we walk the user through a short tutorial on how to work with the financial systems to improve his or her credit score in order to gain enough reputation to secure a fair loan rather than living off of payday loans. There is an additional discussion and QnA section which we have not fully implemented yet, however. We're working on building comment threads.

## How we built it
The application was built using the React framework and Typescript, and we developed it in Visual Studio Code. The entire project was completed collaboratively by 2 team members.

## Challenges we ran into
This project was quite challenging since it was our first hackathon. Firstly, we had trouble figuring out how to create individual routing for discussion threads which may have needed a backend database, but we're not certain. Secondly, we struggled greatly with implementing React Map GL and its "Find Nearby Banks" feature.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building this in 24 hours was difficult, though we're glad to experience our first hackathon and connect with all of our peers. We gained valuable collaboration skills for quick brainstorming and prototype development.

## What we learned
We learned about quite a lot of cool libraries and concepts, including:  
- React State Management
- React Map GL
- Taking risks, failing, learning, and trying more efficiently.
- Reading documentation and taking relevant information from the provided code examples.

## What's next for EnHence
In the future, we plan a number of new ideas for EnHence:
- We want to be more specific with each loan and bank information by providing pros and cons to condense information into easily understandable pieces.
- For the map, we would like to have people read the strategy and have easy access to view banks around them using a Nearby Search feature.
- We want to implement a Loan Calculator to help people determine monthly payments according to the loan amount, term, and interest rate. We're planning to make continuous slider components and a continuously changing result while adjusting the variables controlled by those sliders.

We would like to implement this into a mobile app instead, possibly using Flutter with Dart.
